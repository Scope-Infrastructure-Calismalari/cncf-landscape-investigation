# Introduction
The goal of the cloud native landscape is to compile and organize all cloud native open source projects and proprietary products into categories, providing an overview of the current ecosystem.

CNCF Landscape has 6 categories

* Provisioning—includes tools required for the foundational infrastructure upon which the cloud environments and supporting technologies will function. 
* Runtime—includes tools necessary to run containers in cloud native environments. 
* Orchestration & Management—includes the tools necessary to orchestrate and manage containers, applications, and resources. 
* App Definition & Development—includes tools that enable applications to send and store data and tools needed to build and deploy applications.
* Observability & Analysis—includes tools that help monitor applications and alert stakeholders of any issue. 
* Platforms—includes platforms that bundle multiple functionalities and tools. These platforms help configure and fine-tune multiple tools to help organizations more easily adopt cloud native technologies.
